In CashRegister, when cart is paid, a transaction is added to closed transactions [can be edited in ShopSoldArticlesViews/Transactions Grid]

ClientShoppingCart cannot be closed unless it's empty, even if it has been paid [for the moment, it's possible to do this]
When paying ClientShoppingCart, a transaction is created in ClientCart and is added to closed transactions [cannot be edited in TransactionView]
When reopening a ClientShoppingCart, related transaction is removed from closed transactions and reset in ClientShoppingCart

Shop module overview:
	ShopView
		CashRegisterView(ShopViewModel.CashRegisterViewModel)
			ShoppingCartView(CashRegisterViewModel.ShoppingCart ***)
		or
		ClientShoppingCartsView(ShopViewModel.ClientShoppingCartsViewModel)
			ClientShoppingCartView(ClientShoppingCartsViewModel.SelectedClient of type ClientShoppingCartViewModel)
				ShoppingCartView(ClientShoppingCartViewModel.ShoppingCart ***) [unpaid]
				or
				Some controls + ShoppingCartView(ClientShoppingCartViewModel.ShoppingCart ***) [paid]
			or
			List of buttons (ClientShoppingCartsViewModel.Clients of type ClientShoppingCartViewModel) [Click switch to other view]
		or
		ShopSoldArticlesViews(ShopViewModel)
			3 grids (bound on Transactions, PaidCarts and SoldArticles)


Don't use Savetransactions, but use InsertTransaction, UpdateTransactions, DeleteTransactions -> REDO ShopTransaction

Move ShopViewModel and ClientShoppingCartsViewModel in 2 separate modules
Split SessionDL into TransactionDL, ClientCartDL, NotesDL, SessionDL

Rethink ClientCart, Transactions(ShopTransaction, TransactionFullArticle, ShopTransactionItem), Closure
	ShopTransaction and ShopTransactionItem are identical except for RaisePropertyChanged ==> remove ShopTransactionItem and use ShopTransaction instead

Transaction edition: we should save original transaction in transaction

TransactionManager: singleton used to share Transactions between view model without passing thru DL -> current implementation is useless. first we have to simplify domain and vm models
ClientCartManager: same as TransactionManager but for client cart

Localization

Business Layer to abstract Data access + add Mail sending, file save, ... within
add informative logging
article refund (client doesn't want anymore an already paid article !! only for cash payment)
BubbleMouseWheelBehavior:
	datagrid column are not recomputed correctly (reproduce: zoom in 5-6 times then zoom out 5-6 times)
	window title is not zoomed
finish mobile article selector view

popup style

inventory:
!! after import -> every article guid are modified -> shopping carts and backup files are invalid

known issues:
after creating a new article, article cannot be added to shopping cart with enter
 ==> it seems KeyFriendlyAutoCompleteBox lose SelectedItem once entered is pressed
