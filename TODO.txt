Add methods in DataAccess to save current shop, carts (load/save/backup)
Remove players and cards module

IModule: with method GotFocus

Business Layer to abstract Data access + add Mail sending, file save, ... within
add informative logging
AskNameEmailPopup: check email validity
article refund (client doesn't want anymore an already paid article !! only for cash payment)
PlayersDb: store the list of players (similar to ArticlesDb + call load from MainViewModel)
Players -> remove save button, save automatically once a modification has been done
BubbleMouseWheelBehavior:
	datagrid column are not recomputed correctly (reproduce: zoom in 5-6 times then zoom out 5-6 times)
	window title is not zoomed
finish mobile article selector view

rename PPC.Popups in PPC.Module.Common

when starting: detect if a backup files exists -> if true, propose to reload (if no reload, delete backup files with confirmation popup)

popup style

Reload: notes
Closure: Domain.Closure should be saved on disk instead of CashRegisterClosure

Transaction edition: we should save original transaction in transaction

ShopTransaction should contain an Id (BSonId)

inventory:
!! after import -> every article guid are modified -> shopping carts and backup files are invalid

known issues:
after creating a new article, article cannot be added to shopping cart with enter
 ==> it seems KeyFriendlyAutoCompleteBox lose SelectedItem once entered is pressed

workaround to fix:
PlayerViewModel: Load must be called after Save to reset row.IsNewItem
